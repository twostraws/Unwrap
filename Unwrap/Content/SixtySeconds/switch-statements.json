    "correct": [
        {
            "answer": "Switch statements are often clearer to read than multiple <code>if<\/code> conditions.",
            "reason": "They help us by focusing on one specific check, rathe than many possible checks."

        {
            "answer": "Code from the following case will be run if you use <code>fallthrough<\/code>.",
            "reason": "By default Swift will stop executing code in a switch block once it reaches the end of a case that was matched."

        {
            "answer": "You must list all outcomes as <code>case<\/code> statements or use <code>default<\/code>.",

            "answer": "The default case is written as <code>default:<\/code> rather than <code>case default:<\/code>.",

        {
            "answer": "If you want to match all other values, use <code>default<\/code>.",

        {
            "answer": "The default case is always needed.",
